# Problem Track: Student Community

# Problem Statement:
KIIT university has a very large campus. It is impossible to know the location of every single campus, hostel, sports and recreational areas, etc. This especially plagues freshers, who may have trouble navigating to certain places. KIIT provides no official navigation system to allow students to find their way around. We provide a convenient interface to reliably guide students to their destination within the KIIT campus. We also provide updates on events, coordinated with their respective locations. We also update users on popular KIIT "hotspots".

# Guide to our website:
-> Click on the Locations tab to go to our map interface, implemented via the open source openstreetmap library.
  - Click on any option within the dropdown menus provided.
  - You will get markers to the precise location of various important kiit landmarks.
  - You have the option to view the larger map on openstreetmap, where you can get directions to the location, from your current location.
  - These locations have been verified by students, to ensure accuracy.
  - You get images and a brief description, when selecting any option.

-> Bus routes. 
  - Here, you get a list of bus routes to and from campuses and hostels
  - Timings are provided alongside routes

-> Events.
  - You can browse various events taking place, and check out their locations.
  - In the future, we will link out to kiit social media, and display media updates in the events tab.

-> Community.
  - A dummy page to display posts associated with kiit events.
  - In the future, we can add chat forums here, where people can ask questions about event timings, etc.
  - We could integrate disqus, etc. or even an anonymous forum-type application powered by the decentralised database, gun.js.
