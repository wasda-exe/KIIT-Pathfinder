# KIIT-Pathfinder

KIIT university has a very large campus. It is impossible to know the location of every single campus, hostel, sports and recreational areas, etc. This especially plagues freshers, who may have trouble navigating to certain places. KIIT provides no official navigation system to allow students to find their way around. We provide a convenient interface to reliably guide students to their destination within the KIIT campus. We also provide updates on events, coordinated with their respective locations. We also update users on popular KIIT "hotspots".
